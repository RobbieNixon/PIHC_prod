      At Patience In Home Care (PIHC),  we know we are only as good as our
      employees.  Some larger companies Patience has noticed some of the larger
      health care companies in the area lose sight of engaging, appreciating and
      rewarding strong work by their Nurses and PCA's. At PIHC, we are going to
      do mid-year and annual reviews and regularly engage and be open to our
      team to continuously improve our organization and enable our employees to
      thrive and grow with us!

  - heading: Appreciation for Our Clients
    text: At PIHC, we are never content until your loved ones are.  We know our best
      referrals and our reputation count on those in our care and we will
      actively engage them to hear their ideas and continuously improve our
      services for them.  We hope to expand services to provide new ways to
      entertain and engage our clients as we grow and allow our clients to drive
      what they need and want most.
