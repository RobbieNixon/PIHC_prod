      At Patience In Home Care (PIHC),  we know we are only as good as our
      employees.  Some larger companies Patience has noticed some of the larger
      health care companies in the area lose sight of engaging, appreciating and
      rewarding strong work by their Nurses and PCA's. At PIHC, we are going to
      do mid-year and annual reviews and regularly engage and be open to our
      team to continuously improve our organization and enable our employees to
      thrive and grow with us!

      Patience In-Home Care's founder, Patience Nixon, is passionate about
      in-home care, helping others and running the business the right way with
      the right people. Patience is an RN having 20+ years working in health
      care (senior living, assisted living, group home, private duty nursing).
      She has been highly sought after by her previous and current employers for
      the level of care and experience she provides. Patience has worked in
      in-home care and institutional elderly care for many years and has taken
      care of clients with various trach and ventilator needs (i.e., Muscular
      Dystrophy, ALS, and quadriplegic clients) as well as elderly clients
      (i.e., clients with dementia & Alzheimer’s).
